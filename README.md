# Fancy counter

This is the first project in bytegrad's [Professional react & next.js course](https://bytegrad.com/courses/professional-react-nextjs).

I used this project as a demo to learn about [PWAs](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/).

You can see the working project in action in [here](https://hessamcheraghi.github.io/fancy-counter/).
